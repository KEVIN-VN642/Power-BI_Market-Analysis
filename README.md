# Market Analysis for a Clothing Chain

An online national clothing chain needs to create a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they donâ€™t know who to target. They have three products in mind:

Shirt: $25, 
Sweater: $100, 
Leather Bag: $1,000

We will conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

# Project Environment and Data Sources

All work for the project will be completed using the Microsoft Power BI desktop application.

For viewing the raw spreadsheet data outside of that platform, students will need to use Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

The project will use a variety of data sources, including

## US Census Bureau
  - Average income
  - Location
  - Population
  - Industry
## Business Data
  - Product inventory
  - Product prices
  - Customer rating
  - Product return rate
## Customer Data
  - Customer ID
  - Names
  - Location
  - Date of birth
  - Purchase history
